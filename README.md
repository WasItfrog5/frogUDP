# frogUDP
## a easy to learn and open source library to communicate with UDP servers

# to compile do g++ -o exename filename.cpp -lfrogUdp

# read main.cpp in frogExamples folder

# *why use this*
*idk, if you want to learn how winsock2.h works (this code is pretty messy so) or if you want to build something with this, this was meant for interacting with tello drone using c++
source code is in .cpp file*
